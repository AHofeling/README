# Hey, I'm Andrew 👋

**Security Researcher | Infrastructure Lab Architect | Building & Breaking in Public**

I architect, exploit, and document enterprise-grade infrastructure labs — then turn those lessons into **technical deep-dives, automation tools, and defense strategies**.

## 🧪 Main Project (WIP)

**👉 Hybrid Malware Research & Purple Team Deployment**
I am currently rebuilding my homelab on new hardware to consolidate three primary functions:

* [cite_start]**Malware Analysis & Detonation:** Safe execution and behavioral tracking of live samples[cite: 17, 53].
* [cite_start]**Automated Deployment:** Streamlining the spin-up of victim and attacker infrastructure using custom scripts[cite: 38, 40].
* [cite_start]**Purple Team Operations:** Simulating enterprise attack vectors like **Kerberoasting and DCSync** to validate Splunk-based detection engineering[cite: 34, 36, 37].

### 🛠️ WIP: Gentoo-Hardened (Qubes OS Alternative)
[cite_start]I am currently researching and documenting a transition from **Qubes OS** to a **Hardened Gentoo** implementation[cite: 17, 54]. This project focuses on:
* Implementing **Xen virtualization** on a Gentoo base for domain isolation.
* Utilizing **Hardened Gentoo profiles** (SSP, PIE, and Grsecurity/PaX logic) to minimize the attack surface of the analysis host.
* Customizing kernel configurations to strip unnecessary drivers, further reducing potential exploitation vectors during detonation.
