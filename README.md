# Hey, I'm Andrew 👋

**Security Researcher | Infrastructure Lab Architect | Building & Breaking in Public**

I architect, exploit, and document enterprise-grade infrastructure labs — then turn those lessons into **technical deep-dives, automation tools, and defense strategies**.

## 🧪 Main ProjectS (WIP)

###**👉 Hybrid Malware Research, Deployment & Purple Team Lab**
I am currently rebuilding my homelab on new hardware to consolidate three primary functions:

* **Malware Analysis & Detonation:** Safe execution and behavioral tracking of live samples within isolated environments.
* **Automated Deployment:** Streamlining the spin-up of victim and attacker infrastructure using custom scripts.
* **Purple Team Operations:** Simulating enterprise attack vectors like **Kerberoasting and DCSync** to validate Splunk-based detection engineering.

### 🛠️ WIP: Gentoo-Based ephemeral VM set (Qubes OS Alternative)
I am currently researching and documenting a transition from **Qubes OS** to a **Hardened Gentoo** implementation. This project focuses on:
* Implementing **Xen virtualization** on a Gentoo base for domain isolation.
* Utilizing **Hardened Gentoo profiles** (SSP, PIE, and Grsecurity/PaX logic) to minimize the attack surface of the analysis host.
* Customizing kernel configurations to strip unnecessary drivers, further reducing potential exploitation vectors during detonation.

## 📌 Featured Repos

* **[HARD_device_attack](https://github.com/Ondrik8/HARD_device_attack)** — A massive repository of hardware and radio exploitation resources. It covers **4G/5G cellular hijacking**, **SS7/Telecom vulnerabilities**, **CAN-Bus car hacking**, and **IoT/Firmware reverse engineering**. It serves as a core technical reference for my research into hardware-level attack surfaces.*
* **[OPSEC-OSINT-Tools](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools)** — Tools for operational security and open-source intelligence, supporting my work in identifying **attacker-controlled infrastructure**.
* **[theZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo)** — A repository of live malware; utilized for detonation and analysis within my custom **malware analysis lab environment**.
